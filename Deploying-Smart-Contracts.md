# Deploying Smart Contracts

## Deplyoment Process

1. Write code in Remix and compile it
2. After compilation, Remix IDE generates many artifacts.
  For example: 
    - ByteCode
    - ABI
    - Function Hashes
    - Gas Estimation
    - Web3Deploy script
    
    Remix provides the Web3 deployment script which contains a bytecode, ABI and account details. 
3. To deply the smart contract, just execute the Web3Deploy script.
4. After successful deployment, the address is generated by hashing a creator's account number and nonce. 
5. To interact with smart contract, we will use the smart contract address, ABI definition and function hashes.

* Note: EVM provides execution environment for a smart contract bytecode. Execution of a smart contract creation transaction results in the deployment of this smart contract code on the EVM. It is permanently stored in the EVM for future invocation.
